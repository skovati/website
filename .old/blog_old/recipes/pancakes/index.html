<h2 id="simple-pancake-recipe">Simple Pancake Recipe</h2>
<p>This is a simple, effective recipe for a simple, effective food.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>28 g butter (2 tbsp)</li>
<li>25 g sugar (2 tbsp)</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>5 ml vanilla extract (2 tsp)</li>
<li>400 ml milk (1 &amp; 3/4 cup)</li>
<li>6 g salt (1 tsp)</li>
<li>16 g baking powder (1.25 tbsp)</li>
<li>200-300 g flour (1.5-2.5 cups)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-batter">The Batter</h3>
<p>Melt the butter without it getting too hot, I like to use a microwave safe glass measuring cup. Mix in the sugar and beat the egg into the butter thoroughly, I just use a fork. Mix in the vanilla, milk, salt, and baking powder. Start mixing in a small portion of the flour, adding more until you reach a desired consistency. Don’t over-mix, the batter should be thick and lumpy. Batter should fall from the fork easily, but not too easily. The thicker the batter, the thicker the pancake, so don’t worry too much about the consistency—you’ll get a feel for it after a few attempts. Let the batter rest in order to hydrate the flour while you heat up your pan.</p>
<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<p>Heat your pan of choice—I use cast iron―to medium heat. Put butter or oil in the pan. When the butter starts to brown or the oil is glossy, pour in the batter. Look for bubbles on the edges of the cake. Take a peek at the underside and when you think it’s ready give it a flip. Doing the chef-style pan flip gives better results for large cakes, but you risk losing it all over the floor. When the cake seems done, cook for another 30 seconds to make sure, and move to a cooling plate. Enjoy.</p>
