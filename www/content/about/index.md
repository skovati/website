## welcome to skovati.dev

I'm a computer engineering student and amateur mathematician from the midwest region

a few things I'm passionate about:
- digital minimalism
- ethical & sustainable technology
- free & open source software
- unix philosophy
- cryptography/cybersecurity
- self-hosted infrastructure
- analog & digital circuits
- frugality
- privacy & anonymity

on this site, check out my [blog](https://skovati.dev/blog/)([rss](https://skovati.dev/blog/index.xml)), my [gitea](https://git.skovati.dev/) instance, the [books](https://books.skovati.dev/) I'm reading, or the [status](https://status.skovati.dev/) of my servers

lately, besides schoolwork, I've been working on small projects like
- [gosh](https://github.com/skovati/gosh), an extremely simple unix shell written in Go
- [kirpto](https://github.com/skovati/kripto), a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker that pulls data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- [micro](https://github.com/skovati/micro), a collection of scripts for Arduino microcontollers

professionally, I work as a Cloud Engineer, deploying products and applications on cloud platforms like GCP and AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
