 vimtutor, Vim&amp;rsquo;s built in tutorial, if Vim is installed on your system, just run vimtutor for an interactive tutorial Ben Awad&amp;rsquo;s Tutorial - watch this first, no BS, beginner to advanced DistroTube&amp;rsquo;s Vim series - moderate BS, takes it slow And for Vim-god inspiration, check out a few Luke Smith videos - dude himself is BS, but rocks at Vim And these Vim meetup talks are a good rabbit hole  Anyways&amp;hellip; the post&amp;hellip;</description>
