<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
<li>1-1.5 cups flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>oregano</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>1/3 cup canned pureed tomatoes or pasta sauce</li>
<li>fresh basil</li>
<li>4 ounces whole milk mozzarella</li>
<li>any other toppings you want (garlic, onions, peppers, meat)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-dough">The Dough</h3>
<p>Mix the yeast, sugar, and water together in a bowl and let sit for 5-10 minutes. I like to wait until I can smell the yeast to make sure it&rsquo;s active and happy. Put in one cup of flour and the salt, and start kneading with your hands. Keep adding flour as needed to keep the dough from being too sticky, but don&rsquo;t add too much! Knead until the dough passes the &ldquo;window pane test&rdquo; where you stretch it out carefully and check to see if you can see light through it without it ripping. When ready, place in a small bowl with olive oil and cover with cloth and let rise—at least 24 hours in the fridge, or 1-2 hours at room temp, until size has increased and the dough is very soft.</p>
<p>In a 10 inch cast iron pan, drizzle a little olive oil. You don&rsquo;t need much—the dough is already oiled. Put in some oregano, black pepper, salt, and optionally some cornmeal. Spread that mixture around the pan. Grab the dough and rotate it slowly so it falls into a circular shape. Place and fit into the pan, and let proof another 20 minutes or so as you get the toppings ready.</p>
<h3 id="the-sauce">The Sauce</h3>
<p>Normally, I&rsquo;m lazy, and I just end up using some store bought pasta sauce. I think this works totally fine, but if you want to get fancy you can use those purred tomatoes (or blend your own), and combine them with some olive oil and chopped basil leaves.</p>
<h3 id="cooking-the-pizza">Cooking the Pizza</h3>
<p>There are two main methods I go between when cooking these: if the oven can get pretty hot, around 550+° F, I usually just max out the oven and bake it in the pan anywhere from 10-15 minutes, checking on it every couple minutes to make sure the crust is baking nicely.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your oven doesn&rsquo;t get too hot, or you really want a crispy crust on the bottom, you can cook it on the stove and then broil it to finish. Turn a burner on medium and the broiler on high.</p>
<h3 id="dressing-the-pizza">Dressing the Pizza</h3>
<p>Depending on which cooking method you want to use, you&rsquo;ll either add all the toppings at once or at different times. Regardless of which method you use, you&rsquo;ll want to saute toppings like onions or peppers for a few minutes to make sure they&rsquo;re fully cooked at the end. If baking in the oven, saute your toppings and then spread the sauce, toppings, and cheese on top of the pizza and throw it in the oven. If cooking on the stove, add the sauce right away, and cook on medium for around 7-8 minutes, until the dough starts bubbling underneath. Then, add the rest of your toppings now, making sure the cheese is as cold as possible. Then, throw under the broiler for 4-5 minutes, or to your liking.</p>
<h3 id="and-thats-it">And that&rsquo;s it!</h3>
<p>Once your preferred cooking method is done, take the pan out and let it cool for several minutes. If you used enough oil the pizza shouldn&rsquo;t stick at all. Enjoy!</p>
