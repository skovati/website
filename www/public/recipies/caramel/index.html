<p>Dangerously easy to make soft caramel candies. Read through the whole recipe before starting so you&rsquo;re comfortable with the process.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter</li>
<li>1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy whipping cream</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water</li>
<li>1/4 cup (60 ml) light corn syrup</li>
<li>1 cup (200 grams) sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon course or flaked sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-pan">Preparing the pan</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to do this step early, as things will be moving quick down the line. I like to use a bread loaf pan to cool my caramels in. Take a sheet of parchment paper and line the bottom and sides of a loaf pan. Then, take a small amount of vegetable oil and spread it on the parchment paper—gotta make sure they don&rsquo;t stick! Set this pan aside.</p>
<h3 id="heating-the-sugar-solution">Heating the sugar solution</h3>
<p>In a small saucepan, combine the water, corn syrup, and sugar. When pouring the sugar in, aim for the middle, and try not to get any sugar crystals on the side of the pan. Use a spatula to gently combine the water and sugar until everything is hydrated. Heat this over medium heat until the sugar solution comes to a boil. Once boiling, cover the pan with its lid for a minute or so—this is to create some condensation in the pan which helps any sugar stuck on the side of the pan fall down into the boiling mixture. If you have too much sugar on the sides of the pan, this can cause a gritty texture in your final product. Remove the lid and place a candy thermometer in the pan. Cook for 5-10 minutes until the solution reaches 320° F. While the solution is cooking, cut your stick of butter into chunks and place in a microwave safe glass measure cup. Add the heavy whipping cream, and microwave this solution for a minute or two until the butter has melted. Set this aside for the next step. As soon as the sugar reaches 320° F, start the next step.</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-butter-cream">Adding the butter cream</h3>
<p>Once the sugar reaches 320° F, add about 1/6th of the butter cream solution and start mixing it in with the base of the candy thermometer. Repeat this several times until all the cream has been incorporated. The sugar solution will bubble violently while this is happening, don&rsquo;t worry, just keep adding the solution to bring the temperature down. After all the cream has been mixed in, heat this solution for another few minutes until it reaches 240° F. This will create a soft caramel—if you want slightly harder caramels, heat a few more degrees, but no hotter than 245° F. As soon as the solution reaches your desired temperature, take it off the heat and pour it into the prepared loaf pan.</p>
<h3 id="letting-it-cool">Letting it cool</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t touch this for at least 20-30 minutes. Then sprinkle your sea salt on top. Let sit for another 1-3 hours—really as long as you can manage. Then, lift the parchment paper out of the pan, and set the caramels on a cutting board. Spray a sharp knife with cooking spray, and then cut into small cubes. Wrap with or place on parchment paper and store in an airtight container or the fridge for best longevity. Enjoy!</p>
