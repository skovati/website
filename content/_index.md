I'm a computer engineer and amateur mathematician from the midwest region of the states

a few things I'm passionate about:
- digital minimalism
- simple, ethical, and sustainable technology
- free and open source software
- self hosted and decentralized systems
- cryptography and cybersecurity
- electronics and circuits
- privacy and anonymity

check out my [articles](/articles) below (or from [rss](/articles/index.xml))

lately I've been working on small projects like
- [symposium](https://github.com/skovati/symposium), a refreshingly simple text chat application
- [oldpaper](https://github.com/skovati/oldpaper), a minimal RSS reader

professionally, I write modeling and simulation software for a space science research and development lab
